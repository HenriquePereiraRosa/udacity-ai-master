Project Environment
Start Workspace

Workspaces will shut down after 30 minutes of inactivity. Any running processes will be stopped.

Workspaces may take up to 5 minutes to start.

By using the workspace in the Udacity platform, we will already have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed for you to use. You can, however, validate the installations like this:

Check which version of Python is installed:
!python --version
My version shows: Python 3.9.19

Check which version of Jupyter Notebook you are using:
!jupyter-notebook --version
My version shows: 7.1.2

Install the Requirements for the Project using:
!pip install datasets pandas matplotlib seaborn pyarrow
The versions of these softwares show:

datasets                  3.0.1
matplotlib                3.9.2
matplotlib-inline         0.1.6
pandas                    2.2.3
pyarrow                   17.0.0
seaborn                   0.13.2
^ Tip: A fancy pip command to specifically get the specs for a particular list of requirements can be done like so: !pip list | grep -E 'datasets|pandas|matplotlib|seaborn|pyarrow'

Workspace Instructions
Inside of the Udacity workspace Jupyter Notebook, simply run the cells by clicking into each one you want to run and press: [SHIFT] [ENTER] . This will tell Jupyter Notebook that you want to execute the Python code inside of the selected cell.

You can also add cells above, and below inside of the Jupyter Notebook, but you will not need to do that. You could try testing different functions or scripts by writing outside of the predefined cells.

Tip: If you need to restart the entire Jupyter Notebook, that is also an option if you get stuck. However, if you have made a lot of progress, make sure to save your code outside of the platform, such as in a notes app, in your code editor, or in a word processor, so that you do not lose your work.
